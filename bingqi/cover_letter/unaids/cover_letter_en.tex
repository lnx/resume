\begin{spacing}{1.5}
I am a graduate student from Peking University Health Science Center, School of Public Health. I'd like to apply for this intern position of China-African Health Collaboration.

I am so intensely interested in HIV prevention work, and am taking part in some relevant research programs.  During my internship in Ministry of Education, I wrote a review about  VCT detection condition of foreign universities, which provided them a basis for policy making. In addition, in my graduate project, I studied the attitudes of college students for involving HIV test in entry health examination, and its analysis result can be used for supplementing and perfecting the health examination policy for college students.

The study, research and practice during the graduate school makes me qualified for this job. For studying, I have learnt the basic knowledge of preventive medicine, and I can use statistical analysis software SPSS to do relevant analysis work. For researching, I published a paper on core periodical, and involved in some relevant translating and writing works, and the ability of paper writing was systematicly trained. Further, I am capable of designing graduate project independently, which includes questionnaire compiling, investigation organizing and result analyzing. For practicing, I worked at Ministry of Education and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention as an intern, and got endorsed by the mentors. Also, I have good computer skills in office softwares.

I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future.
